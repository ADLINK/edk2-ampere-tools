#
# ====================================================
# The configuration file format is extremely simplistic:
# - Each platform has a short name.
# - A platform entry starts by the short name held in square brackets, '[]'
# - Within each entry, all options are described in a NAME=VALUE scheme,
#   with the name being whatever comes before the first '=' on the line,
#   and the value being everything that comes after it.
#
# Mandatory options:
# - LONGNAME		A more descriptive name of the platform.
# - DSC			Pointer to the EDK2 build description file. (The
#			pandaboard is excused, all other ports must have this.)
# - ARCH		String describing the architecture to build for.
#			Currently supported are AARCH32 and AARCH64.
# - UEFI_BIN		Name of executable image produced.
# - UEFI_IMAGE_DIR	Build output directory name, relative to 'Build'.
#
# Options for Trusted OS
# Note that OP-TEE (https://github.com/OP-TEE/optee_os) is the only currently
# supported Trusted OS
# - BUILD_TOS		Set to "yes" if the build should automatically build
#   			Trusted OS, mainly for ARM Trusted Firmware.
#			If this is set, you must also set ATF_SPD!
#			Else we will not know which specific Trusted OS to
#			build.
#			Set to "debug" to create a debug build.
# - TOS_PLATFORM	Platform name for Trusted OS build, if
#   			different from ARM Trusted Firmware platform
#			or UEFI platform name.
# - TOS_PLATFORM_FLAVOR	If a core platform has multiple flavors, specify which
#			flavor here.
#
# Options for ARM Trusted Firmware platforms
# - BUILD_ATF		Set to "yes" if the build should automatically build
#   			ARM Trusted Firmware and a fip containing UEFI image.
#			Set to "debug" to create a debug build.
# - ATF_PLATFORM	Platform name for ARM Trusted Firmware build, if
#   			different from UEFI platform name.
# - SCP_BIN		SCP image to pass to ARM Trusted Firmware.
# - TOS_BIN		Trusted OS image to pass to ARM Trusted Firmware.
# - TOS_BIN_EXTRA1	First extra Trusted OS image
# - TOS_BIN_EXTRA2	Second extra Trusted OS image
#			The path is relative to
#			$EDK2_DIR/Build/$PLATFORM_IMAGE_DIR/$BUILD_PROFILE/FV/.
#			To actually build the Trusted OS, you must also set
#			ATF_SPD.
# - ATF_SPD		Name of Secure Payload Dispatcher
#			To actually build the Trusted OS, you must also set
#			TOS_BIN.
#
# Optional options:
# - BUILDFLAGS		Any special flags you want to pass to the build command.
# - ATF_BUILDFLAGS	Any special flags you want to pass to the ARM Trusted
#			Firmware build command.
# - TOS_BUILDFLAGS	Any special flags you want to pass to the Trusted OS
#			build command.
# - EXTRA_FILES		Any additional files to be copied to output dir.
# - EXEC_FILES		Any additional files to be copied - relative to <ARCH>
#			directory in target build root (<TARGET>_<TOOLCHAIN>)
#			instead of FV dir.
# - PREBUILD_CMDS	Any commands you want to execute before the build step.
# - POSTBUILD_CMDS	Any commands you want to execute after the build step.
# - PACKAGES_PATH	Additional directories to search for packages under.
# - INF                 Point to a .inf (in addition to a .dsc) in order to
#                       build a single component (standalone driver/app).
